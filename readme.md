# How To Grunt

Simple example project demonstrating how to use [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com). There's a forthcoming ACRL Tech Connect blog post which will reference this.

#### Setup

- Install [Node](https://nodejs.org) by downloading and running the installer
- Open a command prompt and ensure that `node --version` & `npm --version` are returning version information and thus on your path
    + If they're not on your path you'll have to do a little web searching, "how do I add to path on {{insert operating system}}" should be even to get you going
- Run `npm install -g grunt-cli` to install Grunt **g**lobally
- Inside this project, run `npm install` to get all the necessary pieces
- Now `grunt build` and `grunt watch` should work as described in the blog post
